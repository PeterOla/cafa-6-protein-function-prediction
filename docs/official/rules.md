## Key implications (practical)

- External data/tools are allowed if they are publicly available at no cost or meet the “Reasonableness Standard”.
- Competition data is non-commercial / academic use only; don’t redistribute outside participants.
- No private sharing of competition code/data outside your team; public sharing must be on Kaggle competition forums/notebooks.
- Winners must be prepared to release winning submission code under an OSI-approved licence and provide reproducibility details.

Competition Rules
ENTRY IN THIS COMPETITION CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES.
See Section 3.18 for defined terms

The Competition named below is a skills-based competition to promote and further the field of data science. You must register via the Competition Website to enter. To enter the Competition, you must agree to these Official Competition Rules, which incorporate by reference the provisions and content of the Competition Website and any Specific Competition Rules herein (collectively, the "Rules"). Please read these Rules carefully before entry to ensure you understand and agree. You further agree that Submission in the Competition constitutes agreement to these Rules.

These Rules form a binding legal agreement between you and the Competition Sponsor with respect to the Competition. Your competition Submissions must conform to the requirements stated on the Competition Website. Your Submissions will be scored based on the evaluation metric described on the Competition Website. Subject to compliance with the Competition Rules, Prizes, if any, will be awarded to Participants with the best scores, based on the merits of the data science models submitted. See below for the complete Competition Rules. For Competitions designated as hackathons by the Competition Sponsor (“Hackathons”), your Submissions will be judged by the Competition Sponsor based on the evaluation rubric set forth on the Competition Website (“Evaluation Rubric”). The Prizes, if any, will be awarded to Participants with the highest ranking(s) as determined by the Competition Sponsor based on such rubric.

You cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot enter or submit from multiple accounts.

2. COMPETITION-SPECIFIC RULES
In addition to the provisions of the General Competition Rules below, you understand and agree to these Competition-Specific Rules required by the Competition Sponsor:

1. TEAM LIMITS
a. The maximum Team size is five (5). b. Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the Team leader. In order to merge, the combined Team must have a total Submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of Submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running. For Hackathons, each team is allowed one (1) Submission; any Submissions submitted by Participants before merging into a Team will be unsubmitted.

2. SUBMISSION LIMITS
a. You may submit a maximum of five (5) Submissions per day. b. You may select up to two (2) Final Submissions for judging. c. For Hackathons, each Team may submit one (1) Submission only.

3. COMPETITION TIMELINE
a. Competition Timeline dates (including Entry Deadline, Final Submission Deadline, Start Date, and Team Merger Deadline, as applicable) are reflected on the competition’s Overview > Timeline page.

4. COMPETITION DATA
a. Data Access and Use.

Competition Use and Non-Commercial & Academic Research: You may access and use the Competition Data for non-commercial purposes only, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.

b. Data Security.

You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorised transmission of or unauthorised access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorised transmission or access.

5. WINNER LICENSE
a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following licence(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved licence (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the licence in the preceding Section for that software.

In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible licence are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source licence in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.

6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)

Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate licence to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
